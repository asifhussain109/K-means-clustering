# K-means-clustering
This project is done to learn k_means clustering model using a simple but yet a good dataset of a mall which has information about the customers.
I have gathered the dataset from github.
In this project I have used hopkin's test to determine whether the dataset is good for the model.
Then I have used elbow method to alteast get the range of the clusters i can make in the model.
And then finally used the K-means to get the desired result.
